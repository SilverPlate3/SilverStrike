# SilverStrike.pdf
The attached PDF is a **MUST** read!
It contains the following:
* High-level and low-level explanation on the techniques the tool uses. From how the script is able to retrieve protected files like SAM to the parameters the WinAPI's use for the injection.
* All the modules SilverStrike offers and their commands.
* Requirements 
* Extra ideas for others to try
